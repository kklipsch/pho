# pho - scrapper tool for [gallery3](http://galleryproject.org/) galleries.

This is a quick and dirty tool.  It does not attempt collect metadata or interact with the database in any way.  Instead it works by parsing index files as created by apache (so apache needs to be on).  It assumes the images will bestored in <HOST>/var/albums.
